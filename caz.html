Hello! I am a first-year Ph.D. student at Cornell University in the Computer Science Department. My research focuses on the intersection between higher-order graph theory and large-scale information networks.

I am currently working with Professor Jon Kleinberg looking at hypergraph evolution.

My work is generously supported externally by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation (Cornell Sloan Fellowship) and the National GEM Consortium (GEM Fellowship).

Prior to joining Cornell, I received my B.S. in Computer Science Engineering at UC Davis, where I worked with Professor Jason Lowe-Power and Professor Xin Lui.
